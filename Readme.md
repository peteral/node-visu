# node-visu

Messing around with some new hyped techs.

**HMI system based on following :**
* Docker / micro service architecture
* MongoDB in-memory DB holds current state of objects
* Screens designed in SVG / functional markup connects to object state
* Node-JS as backend
* ReactJS (flux architecture) for frontend
* NPM / webpack build system
* IntelliJ IDE as IDE

## some ideas
* status in objects
* need reusable SVG components mapped to objects
* object properties can be directly used in SVG
  * picture is non-svg
  * runtime SVG generated by backend
* clients receives either SVG transformations or new object state

## TODO
* testing framework for React

## setup environment
* run `npm install`
* run `npm install webpack -g`
