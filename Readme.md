Messing around with some new hyped techs.

**HMI system based on following :**
* Docker / micro service architecture
* MongoDB in-memory DB holds current state of objects
* Screens designed in SVG / Modularization via ReactJS component model
* Node-JS as backend
* ReactJS (flux architecture) for frontend
* NPM / webpack build system
* IntelliJ IDE as IDE

## setup environment
* run `npm install`
* run `npm install webpack -g`
* npm script `build` builds client webapp
* npm script `start` starts the backend

## Next steps
* register all components of a picture in backend
* testing framework for React and node
